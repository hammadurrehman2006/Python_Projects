# Sleuth Project üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

Welcome to the Sleuth Project! This repository contains Python-based projects that are part of my learning journey through Microsoft Learn's path, "Use Python Basics to Solve Mysteries and Find Answers."

## Overview

This project showcases two key Python applications:

- **Personality Quiz**: A fun and interactive quiz that determines personality traits based on user input. It utilizes conditional logic, loops, and functions to evaluate responses and provide results.

- **Caesar Cipher**: An implementation of the classic Caesar Cipher encryption technique. This tool can both encrypt and decrypt messages by shifting the letters in the text by a specified amount. It highlights Python's capabilities in string manipulation, loops, and modular arithmetic.

## Learning Path

These projects are part of the Microsoft Learn path that focuses on using Python basics to solve problems and uncover solutions. Through these exercises, I've deepened my understanding of Python's fundamental concepts and applied them to real-world scenarios.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: The primary language for implementing the projects.
- **Microsoft Learn**: A platform that provided the structured learning path.

## Future Enhancements

I plan to continue enhancing these projects and add more features based on the advanced topics I'll learn in the future. Stay tuned for updates!
